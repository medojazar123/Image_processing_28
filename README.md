## Image_processing_28

This project focuses on image segmentation using deep learning models, including U-Net, Modified U-Net, and DeepLab. The repository includes:

Pre-run Jupyter Notebook: finishedIP.ipynb with outputs already generated.
Python scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation.
Detailed experimental results with configuration settings.

# Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.8+
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
scikit-learn

# Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_link>
cd <repository_folder>

# Load the Pre-run Notebook
The Jupyter notebook finishedIP.ipynb is pre-executed and includes all outputs. You can open it to review the steps and results:
jupyter notebook finishedIP.ipynb

# Prepare the Dataset
Ensure that the required images and masks are placed in the correct directory as described in the notebook or config.yaml. Update the paths in the scripts if necessary.

# The notebook finishedIP.ipynb includes:

Data Preprocessing steps.
Model architecture and training processes.
Results and analysis of trials for U-Net, Modified U-Net, and DeepLab models.
You can navigate through the cells to see visualizations, metrics, and insights gained during the experiments.
